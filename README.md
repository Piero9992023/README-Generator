  ## Description
  The purpose of this project was to make it easier for a user to build their own README file through the terminal using node.js. The motivation behind this project was to showcase my newly learned node.js skills that I have learned in the past week of class. The problem my project solves is that it allows a user to spend more time and focus on their project since they would have a more efficient way to create their README file by using my app. I have learned new concepts about node.js and javascript that I have never crossed before. 
  ## Installation
  The first step was to install the json and inquirer packages to the file. The next step I took was to use the require method to use inquirer. Then I started to create the questions for the README. After that I have created the function to create the README file directory so that it stores the text that the user inputs in the terminal. Then I have created the functions for the license badges to appear if chosen in the generateMarkdown file that is inside the utils folder; inside the same file I had to create a function to generate markdown for the README file so that the text would be passed to the README file.
